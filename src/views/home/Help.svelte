                        To make this work we want to ask you to share your
                        cycling data.

                    <p>
                        We need to know where you ride your bicycle. Your data
                        contributions, combined with the data from many other
                        cyclists, will make cities more adapted to cyclists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All cyclists are welcome to contribute to this project.
                        Some people already track their activity for training
                        purposes. Thatâ€™s great, but we also want to consider
                        other types of activities such as: commuting to work,
                        dropping the kids off at school or a quick ride to the
                        grocery store.
