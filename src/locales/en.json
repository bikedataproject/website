  "Question_two_title": "How does this project work?",
  "Question_two_answerOne": "To make this work we want to ask you to contribute your cycling data. We need to know where you ride your bicycle. Your data contributions, combined with the data from many other cyclists, will make cities more adapted to cyclists.",
  "Question_two_answerTwo": "We ask different types of cyclists (e.g., daily commuters, delivery riders, sportsmen and tourists) to track their bicycle rides via their preferred mobile application and contribute their data to our community-driven bike data platform.
